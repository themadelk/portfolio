 [Intro]

Regulators. We regulate any stealing of his property, we’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You’ve gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some funk
Just rolling in my ride, chilling all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 2-1-3

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on 2-1 and Lewis
Some brothers shooting dice so I said "let's do this"
I jumped out the ride and said "what's up?"
Some brothers pulled some Gats, so I said "I'm stuck"

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peeping me, I'mma glide and swerve
These hookers looking so hard they straight hit the curb
On to big better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm getting jacked, I'm breaking myself
I can't believe they're taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother said "damn, what's next?"

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound-for-pound
I've got to come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They've got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happening in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
Let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

[Nate Dogg]
16 in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they dropping and yelling
It's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my Gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak-mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now Nate got the freaks, and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me: the Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought
They were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said ooh, I like your size
She said my car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would you let me ride
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

[Warren G]
I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level

[Nate Dogg]
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

[Warren G]
Chords, strings, we brings
Melody, G-Funk:
Where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

[Nate Dogg]
If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate
